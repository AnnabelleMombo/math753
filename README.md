# Math 753/853 Introduction to Numerical Methods

University of New Hampshire, fall 2017  
Instructor: John Gibson, john.gibson@unh.edu  
Lecture: MWF 12:40-2:00pm, Kingsbury N129  
Office hours: t.b.d. Kingsbury N309E, or after class  
Prerequisite: Math 426; Math 445 or CS 410 or IAM 550

**Course description**: Introduction to mathematical algorithms and methods of approximation. A wide survey of approximation methods are examined including, but not limited to, polynomial interpolation, root finding, numerical integration, approximation of differential equations, and techniques used in conjunction with linear systems. Included in each case is a study of the accuracy and stability of a given technique, as well as its efficiency and complexity. It is assumed that the student is familiar and comfortable with programming a high-level computer language. (Also offered as CS 853.)

**Lecture**: You are expected to attend lecture. 10% of your grade will determined by your attendance and participation in class (e.g. asking questions). What you are responsible for understanding is defined by what is covered in lecture. You learn best by giving your undivided attention to the lecture, so private discussion and use of cell phones are strictly prohibited.

**Homeworks**: Homeworks will be posted to the [Math 753 website](https://github.com/johnfgibson/math753) most weeks. Homework sets will usually be in form of Julia notebooks, which you modify and then return to the instructor, either via email or [git](https://git-scm.com/) (still to be determined). Discussing homework problems with fellow students is fine, but (1) you should make your own best effort before talking with others, (2) you should get help in the form of *ideas* which you then apply to form your own independent solution, (3) you should *never copy others' work*.  

**Exams**: Exams will cover new material since the last exam, except for the final exam, which is comprehensive. Exams will take place during lecture time on the dates specified on the schedule, unless changes are necessitated by snow days or other official University disruptions. Make-up or alternate exams will be given only for participants in scheduled University varsity athletic events and serious illness (e.g. hospitalization). Please notify the instructor in writing during the first week of class of scheduled University events that conflict with scheduled exams. 

**Grades**: Numerical course grades will be determined according to this formula. 

  numerical grade = 10 class participation + 40 homework + 15 exam<sub>1</sub> + 15 exam<sub>2</sub> + 20 final exam
  
Final letter grades will follow these ranges, approximately

 letter grade  | A | A- | B+ | B | B- | C+ | C | C- | D | F 
 --------------|---|----|----|---|----|----|---|----|---|--
 numerical grade |  94-100 | 90-94 | 87-90 | 84-87 | 80-84 | 77-80 | 74-77 | 70-74 | 60-70 |  < 60



**Accommodations for disabilities**: According to the Americans with Disabilities Act (as amended, 2008), each student with a disability has a right to request services from UNH to accommodate his or her disability. If you are a student with a documented disability or believe you may have a disability that requires accommodations, please contact [Student Accessibility Services (SAS)](http://www.unh.edu/studentaccessibility), 201 Smith Hall. Accommodations letters are created by SAS with the student. Please follow up with your instructor as soon as possibile to ensure timely implementation of the identified accommodations in the letter. Faculty have an obligation to respond once they receive official notice of accommodations from SAS, but they are under no obligation to provide retroactive accommodations.
